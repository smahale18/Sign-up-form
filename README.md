# Sign-up-form

REACT App to create a sign up form

I have used CREATE REACT APP to set up the environment.

Prerequisite:
Node.js (Used v12.4.0)
NPM

How to run this project?

1. Go to the project directory and type this out on terminal
   > npm install
2. > npm start

Future work if this would have been production ready project:
1. i18n for globalization of all strings
2. Testing framework
3. CSS --> SASS or LESS
4. Production scripts to dockerize and run of web servers like NGINX
